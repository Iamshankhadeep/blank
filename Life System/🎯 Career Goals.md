## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

### The Dual Track Advantage

**Don't choose. Build both.**

Engineers often think: "Should I go deep technical or switch to product?"
Product people think: "Should I learn to code or focus on strategy?"

**You're doing BOTH.**

This makes you:
- **Rare** - Few people have both skills
- **Valuable** - Companies pay premium for this
- **Effective** - You can execute end-to-end
- **Strategic** - You understand trade-offs

### Public Learning

**Learn in public. Build in public.**

Everything you learn, share:
- Blog posts about technical concepts
- Product teardowns
- Side project progress
- Mistakes and learnings

This builds:
- **Reputation** - People know your work
- **Network** - Attract opportunities
- **Feedback** - Learn faster
- **Proof** - Portfolio of work

### Consistency Over Everything

**Daily progress compounds exponentially.**

- 1% better each day = 37x better in a year
- Small daily wins > occasional big pushes
- The 3-3-3 Rule ensures consistent progress
