## 🔥 PRODUCTIVITY HACKS

### Morning Routine is Your Competitive Advantage
- **5:30 AM wake = 3.5 hours** before most people start
- This is when you do your best work
- **Protect this time fiercely** - no meetings, no Slack

### The Power of Templates
- Duplicate daily/weekly templates (don't start from scratch)
- Templates = consistency
- Consistency = results

### No Zero Days
- Even if you're tired, do the **3-3-3 minimum**
- Missing one day is okay - just restart tomorrow
- **Consistency > Perfection**

### Batch Similar Tasks
- Code reviews: Do 2-3 at once
- Social posts: Write 3-5 in one sitting
- Recordings: Record multiple if you're in the flow

### Use Dead Time
- Podcast while showering/commuting
- Read articles during lunch
- Listen to courses while exercising

### Weekly Reviews are Critical

- Track what's working
- Adjust what's not
- Celebrate wins
